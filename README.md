# Introduction to Java: Examples and Exercises

Learning Java is a fantastic opportunity to consolidate the OOP concepts you learned with Python, which is why we have two hours a week dedicated to this language. Whether you choose to use Java or Python at the time of the exams, the goal for this half term is to make you feel more confident about programming and the practical aspects of computer science.

Learning only the syntax of a language won't be enough to answer A-Level programming questions successfully, and it certainly won't make you a good software developer/engineer. Practising is the best (and perhaps only) way to achieve fluency, and the skills that are learnt through mastering one language are transferable to another. 

## About the Exercises

Instead of providing a monolithic exercise that could take the entire lesson to complete, I'm providing smaller tasks so that you can familiarise yourselves with the language at your own pace. Exercises will be released each week based on the content that has been taught, though some exercises may contain more content about the language which haven't been covered.

You're more than welcome (and encouraged) to finish the exercises outside the classroom if you don't finish them during the lesson.

## Example Solutions

Example solutions to each exercise are available in their corresponding folders at `Examples/src/exercises.solutions/exXXX/`.

These are not necessarily _model_ solutions, as it's likely that an exercise can be approached in multiple ways.

I highly recommend looking at them but _only_ once you've either completed the exercise yourself, or when you're stuck and both your peers and teacher can't help you progress. You all know well enough by now that skipping straight to the answers is not as effective as trying to tackle the question yourselves first!
