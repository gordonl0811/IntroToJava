# 003: Pokémon Battles

## Requirements
- 000: An encapsulated Dice

## Description

In this exercise we will simulate a watered down Pokémon battle. A `Pokemon` has a `name` and two attributes:
- `attack`: an integer between 1 and 12 inclusive
- `hp`: an integer between 10 and 200 inclusive

A Pokémon battle consists of an unlimited number of rounds. In each round, both Pokémon calculate *attack damage* by rolling two `Dice`s for themselves, then adding their `attack` value to the sum of the rolls. The Pokémon with the higher attack damage wins the round, and the opposing Pokémon loses 20 HP (or however much it has remaining, if it has less than 20 HP). If both Pokémon have the same attack damage for that round, the result is a draw and no HP is lost. The battle finishes when a Pokémon has 0 HP, i.e. it has fainted.

**Design two classes, `Pokemon` and `PokemonBattle`.**

The `Pokemon` class should contain necessary attributes, an appropriate constructor, and **at least** these methods:
```
// Reduce the Pokémon's HP
public void loseHp(int hp);

// Return how much HP should be lost
public int calculateHpLoss();

// Calculate the attack damage for a round
public int calculateAttackDamage();

// Determine if the Pokémon has fainted
public boolean hasFainted();
``` 

Tip: you could use `Math.max()` in `loseHp()` to ensure that the HP hits 0 rather than a negative value.  

The `PokemonBattle` class only needs one *public* method:
```
// Simulates a battle, displaying the  
// results of each round and who wins
public void battle(Pokemon first, Pokemon second);
```

Then, create a `Main` class with a PSVM (`public static void main(String[] args)`) that creates two *appropriately* named `Pokemon`, creates a `PokemonBattle`, then executes the battle.

Your output should look something along these lines:
```
The two Pokémon are:
Pikachu: 6 Attack, 50 HP
Ditto: 4 Attack, 80 HP

---- ROUND 1 ----

Pikachu has 13 Attack Damage
Ditto has 7 Attack Damage

Pikachu attacks Ditto!

End of round stats:
Pikachu: 50 HP
Ditto: 60 HP

---- ROUND 2 ----

Pikachu has 14 Attack Damage
Ditto has 15 Attack Damage

Ditto attacks Pikachu!

End of round stats:
Pikachu: 30 HP
Ditto: 60 HP

---- ROUND 3 ----

Pikachu has 8 Attack Damage
Ditto has 10 Attack Damage

Ditto attacks Pikachu!

End of round stats:
Pikachu: 10 HP
Ditto: 60 HP

---- ROUND 4 ----

Pikachu has 9 Attack Damage
Ditto has 9 Attack Damage

Both Pokémon cancel each other out!

End of round stats:
Pikachu: 10 HP
Ditto: 60 HP

---- ROUND 5 ----

Pikachu has 12 Attack Damage
Ditto has 15 Attack Damage

Ditto attacks Pikachu!

End of round stats:
Pikachu: 0 HP
Ditto: 60 HP

---- BATTLE OVER ----

Ditto wins with 60 HP left!
