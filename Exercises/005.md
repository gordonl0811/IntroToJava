# 005: Music Catalogue

## Requirements

No previous exercises are needed.

## Description

The purpose of this task is to practise using `List<Type>`, either by using `ArrayList` or `LinkedList` (your preference!).

Create a package called `music`. Within this, create a `Song` class that stores its title and duration (in seconds).

Then, create an `Artist` class with a `name` and a `catalogue` (a list of `Songs`). It should have the following methods:

```
public void addSong(String name, int duration);

// Prints out all of the Artist's songs in a nice format, including the title and duration of the song (in minutes)
public void printCatalogue();
```

By now, you should be comfortable enough with creating a PSVM in the `Main` class that Replit provides.

Use this to test your implementation - creating an `Artist` and their `Songs`, printing them out, etc.

## Extension

Create a method, `longerSongs`, that takes in a value (in seconds) and prints out all the songs that last longer than this.
