# 006: Lottery Simulators

## Requirements

No previous exercises are needed.

## Description

The UK National Lottery has several games involving generating random numbers that you need to guess.

1. Create a `NationalLotterySimulator` interface with a single method:

```
// Simulate a round of a National Lottery Game
void simulate();
```

2. The "Lotto" is the flagship game of the National Lottery, where six distinct numbers are randomly chosen between 1 and 49, with a seventh "Bonus Number".

Write a `LottoSimulator` that uses the `NationalLotterySimulator` interface, that simulates this game. For example:

```
Number 1: 41
Number 2: 49
Number 3: 8
Number 4: 15
Number 5: 13
Number 6: 34
Bonus Number: 25
```

This is an easy problem at first glance - the challenge is to have an efficient method of ensuring that
these numbers are unique. Which Java data structure should we use to solve this problem?
