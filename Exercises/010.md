# 010: Modelling a Software Engineering Company - Companies

## Requirements

- 009: Modelling a Software Engineering Company - Employees

## Description

Now that we have our `Employee` implementations, we can define a `Company` interface that has the following methods:

```
// Adds an employee to the company's list of employees
void hireEmployee(Employee employee);

// Searches for an employee and returns the sum of their salary and bonus
// Returns -1 if the employee can't be found
int employeeCompensation(String id);

// Returns the total cost of the company's employees for a year
int annualCost();
```

Create a `TechCompany` class that uses the `Company` interface, keeping your code in a `company` package.



Test your implementations for exercises `009` and `010` yourself in a PSVM within `Main.java`.

Your workspace should look something like this:

```
company/
├─ Company.java
├─ etc
employee/
├─ Employee.java
├─ etc
Main.java
```
