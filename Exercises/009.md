# 009: Modelling a Software Engineering Company - Employees

## Requirements

No previous exercises are needed.

## Description

In this question we'll be creating a very simple (and inaccurate) model of a software engineering team.

Create an `Employee` interface with the following methods:

```
// Returns the Employee's ID
String getId();

// Returns the Employee's salary
int getSalary();

// Returns the bonus that the employee should receive
// You'll be making a "float" value when you multiply by a decimal
// Convert this "float" to an "int" using (int) (expression)
// For example:
// int example = (int) (0.5 * 0.4)
int calculateBonus();
```

A `SoftwareEngineer` is a type of `Employee` that receives a fixed 10% bonus on top of their `salary`.

A `ProductManager` is also a type of `Employee` that also has a `salary`, and also a number of `clients`.
Their bonus is 5% of their salary for each client that they have.

Create the necessary classes/interfaces in a Java package called `employee`, with appropriate constructors for the classes. 

## Extension

You can avoid duplication by using an `abstract` class. You'll run into an issue - we have different implementations of `calculateBonus()` depending on the type of Employee.

The solution to this is to make `calculateBonus` an `abstract` method. 

This says that the subclasses *must* implement/override this method (much like an interface).

The method will look like this within the class:

```
@Override
public abstract int calculateBonus();
```
