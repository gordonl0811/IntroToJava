# 009: Modelling a Software Engineering Company - Employees

## Requirements

No previous exercises are needed.

## Description

In this question we'll be creating a very simple (and inaccurate) model of a software engineering team.

Create an `Employee` interface with the following methods:

```
String getId();

int getSalary();

int calculateBonus();
```

A `SoftwareEngineer` is a type of `Employee` that receives a fixed 10% bonus on top of their `salary`.

A `ProductManager` is also a type of `Employee` that also has a `salary`, and also a number of `clients`.
Their bonus is 5% of their salary for each client that they have.

Create the necessary classes/interfaces in a Java package called `employee`, with appropriate constructors for the classes. 

Hint: avoid duplication by using an `abstract` class (perhaps `AbstractEmployee`?)
