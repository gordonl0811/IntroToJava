# 000: An encapsulated Dice

In the first lesson we created a Dice class that stored the `top` of the Dice and had the following methods:
- `void roll()` - sets `top` to a random integer between 1 and 6
- `int getTop()` - returns the value on the top of the dice
- `int getBottom()` - returns the value on the bottom of the dice

Reimplement this Dice class **with encapsulation**, ensuring that every method and attribute has the appropriate access modifier.

Note: constructors can also be encapsulated, depending on how they are used. The same rules apply - if you want anybody to be able to construct a `Dice`, then you'll want the `Dice()` constructor to be `public`. 

Note: the `Dice` class without encapsulation can be found in this repository in `Examples/src/examples/tools/Dice.java`. If you get stuck, you can use this as a reference to *help* you complete this task.
