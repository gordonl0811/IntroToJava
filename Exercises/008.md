# 008: Refactored LottoSimulator 2.0

## Requirements

- 007: Refactored LottoSimulator

## Description

There is yet another refactoring job that can be made on the 006 sample code.

Read [the documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Set.html#add-E-) for the `add()` method for `Set` implementations.

The method doesn't just add the element to the `Set`, it has a return type which is extremely useful and can help us simplify our code.

Using your solution from 007 (or the example solution), refactor the code once again with this knowledge.
