# 001: Playing Craps with Dice

## Requirements 
- 000: An encapsulated Dice

## Description

In a game of Craps, the user throws two dice, guessing the sum of them. They win if they guess it correctly, and lose if they don't.

Using the `public static void main(String[] args)` method within a `Craps` class, create a simple program that plays a single round of Craps by importing and using the `Dice` class created earlier. The program should report what it's doing - when it throws each dice, the value that appears, the total that the `Dice` make, etc.

## Extension

Improve the program by checking for errors in the user input. For example:
- What happens if they enter a line of text?
- What happens if they guess a number outside the range of 2 to 12?
