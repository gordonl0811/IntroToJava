# 007: Refactored Lotto Simulator

## Requirements

- 006: Lottery Simulators

## Description

Study the solution to 006 (Lottery Simulators) in `Examples/src/exercises/solutions/ex006`.
A comment has indicated a heavily duplicated section of code. Copy the classes from `ex006` and "refactor"
it so that the code for the generation of the unique number is reused appropriately.
